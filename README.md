# SampleBot Intro
Welcome to SampleBot, a bot created by CM for the purpose of setting up a new bot with advanced permissions and whatnot. This file will guide you through some basics.

# Setup
SampleBot, by default, comes with modules required for it to run. It is recommended that you update the modules in `node_modules` in case of a new update.
To do that, you want to type `npm update` in the same directory as the `package.json` file. Also run `npm outdated` to ensure no packages are outdated.

    1. Head over to `https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/` and click "Create an application."
    2. Configure the bot's name, profile picture, and description.
    3. Go to `Bot` and click `Add Bot`. Then, click `Yes, do it!` to the prompt.
    4. Configure your bot's username. Ignore the icon - that has already been configured.
    5. At the section labeled `Token`, click `Copy`. Keep this token in a safe place and **DO NOT GIVE THIS TOKEN TO OTHER PEOPLE.**
